<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Nandini Rawat, a first-year B.Tech student in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence
  at Banasthali Vidyapith, Jaipur, Rajasthan. I have a strong foundation in Java, along with basic knowledge of C and
  HTML, and I’m eager to expand my skills in emerging AI domains like Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
  My goal is to become a successful engineer who builds impactful and innovative solutions. As a quick learner with a 
  strong determination to grow, I’m excited to explore challenging projects, gain hands-on experience, and contribute 
  meaningfully to the tech world.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence fascinates me because of its power to mimic human thinking, learn from data, and bring 
  automation to a whole new level. I’m particularly excited to explore Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing,
  as they combine logic with creativity, enabling computers to understand and interact with humans in smarter ways.</p>

<p>I believe that learning is a continuous journey, especially in fields like programming and AI where technology evolves
  rapidly. As I progress in my studies, I aim to work on projects that challenge my skills, encourage innovative thinking,
  and push me beyond my comfort zone. I’m eager to collaborate with like-minded peers, participate in hackathons, and gain
  hands-on experience that will prepare me for a career at the forefront of technological innovation.
